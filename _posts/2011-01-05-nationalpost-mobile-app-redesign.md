## Material Design    

The current National Post mobile app for iOS and Android are outdated and could benefit from restyling. Material Design guidelines were used to give the app a modern look and feel.\

  **Hamburger Menu**\\
  The current app uses a bottom line menu navigation system that takes up screen real estate. This design uses a more modern "hamburger menu" to give users more options, quickly.

  **Readability**\\
  Readability should be the focus of any news app. Emphasis was given to typography, font size, line spacing, and tracking/kerning to make the text as easy-to-read as possible.
